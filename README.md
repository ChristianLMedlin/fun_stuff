## Snake
##### This project was intended to be a form of practice for object-oriented programming in a fun way. I decided it would be interesting and useful to try PyGame here, as I needed something to create the visual aspect of the game and I've been curious about working with the PyGame library. Although it needs polish, the game is fully functional and you can clone its repository to try it out!

## Rock, Paper, Scissors
##### This game is just a simple project that allows the user to play against the computer in a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The computer's decision is random.
