This repository will be filled with fun, mostly small-scale projects. All of these projects are just made to play around with Python code.

###Rock, Paper, Scissors
#####This game is just a simple project that allows the user to play against the computer in a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The computers decision is random.


###Snake
#####This project is a work in progress. It utilizes PyGame to draw and display the actions of the code. Eventually this will be fully functional. In the future, I hope to build a Machine Learning project that can teach itself to score highly on this.
